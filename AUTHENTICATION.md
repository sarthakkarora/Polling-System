# Authentication System

This document describes the authentication system implemented for the Live Polling System.

## Overview

The system now includes proper authentication pages for both teachers and students, providing a more secure and user-friendly experience.

## Teacher Authentication

### Features
- **Login Form**: Username and password authentication
- **Demo Credentials**: 
  - Username: `teacher`
  - Password: `password123`
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Show/hide password functionality
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during authentication
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for invalid credentials

### Flow
1. User selects "I'm a Teacher" on the main page
2. Redirected to `/teacher/login`
3. Enters credentials
4. Upon successful login, redirected to teacher dashboard

## Student Authentication

### Features
- **Multiple Join Options**:
  - **Simple Join**: Just enter your name
  - **Advanced Join**: Enter name and student ID for tracking
  - **Quick Join**: Generate a random name for instant access
- **Flexible Authentication**: No password required for students
- **Student ID Tracking**: Optional student ID for better tracking

### Flow
1. User selects "I'm a Student" on the main page
2. Redirected to `/student/auth`
3. Chooses authentication method
4. Enters required information
5. Upon successful authentication, redirected to student dashboard

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created
- `TeacherLogin.js`: Teacher authentication component
- `StudentAuth.js`: Student authentication component

### Updated Components
- `UserSelection.js`: Updated to redirect to new auth pages
- `App.js`: Added new routes for authentication pages

### Routes Added
- `/teacher/login`: Teacher login page
- `/student/auth`: Student authentication page

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- **Demo Mode**: Uses hardcoded credentials for demonstration
- **Client-side Validation**: Basic form validation
- **No Persistent Storage**: Credentials not stored

### Production Recommendations
- **Backend Authentication**: Implement proper JWT or session-based auth
- **Database Storage**: Store user credentials securely
- **Password Hashing**: Use bcrypt or similar for password security
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data in .env files
- **HTTPS**: Use SSL/TLS in production

## Usage

### For Teachers
1. Navigate to the application
2. Select "I'm a Teacher"
3. Enter demo credentials (teacher/password123)
4. Access teacher dashboard

### For Students
1. Navigate to the application
2. Select "I'm a Student"
3. Choose authentication method:
   - **Simple**: Just enter your name
   - **Advanced**: Enter name and student ID
   - **Quick**: Get a random name instantly
4. Access student dashboard

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **User Registration**: Allow teachers to create accounts
- **Password Reset**: Email-based password recovery
- **Session Management**: Remember login state
- **Role-based Permissions**: More granular access control
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Additional security layer

### Technical Improvements
- **API Integration**: Connect to backend authentication service
- **Token Management**: Implement JWT token handling
- **Error Handling**: More comprehensive error messages
- **Loading States**: Better UX during authentication
- **Form Validation**: Enhanced client-side validation
